# gps_owntracks
A socket server that accepts TCP connections from cheap Chinese GT-02 (GT-06 protocol) GPS tracker and passes MQTT messages using the owntracks ( http://owntracks.org ) format

There are a number of similar looking GPS trackers that use a variety of different protocols.  The tracker I bought from Amazon is [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B073B5MDTJ).  Although this is nomi9nally a GT-02 tracker I found that it was using a subset of the GT-06 protocol.  I guess that potentially many chinese manufacturers make these devices and depending on what they can get hold of upload slightly different firmware.  A great reference for GPS tracker protocols is [Trackcar](https://www.traccar.org/).  I didn't want or need all of the features of their server, so have decided to create my own lightweight python server which receives the data from the tracker and creates MQTT messages using the [owntracks](http://owntracks.org/) format.  I am already using owntracks which as a usable phone app, so I can then use this to display the location of the GPS device.
